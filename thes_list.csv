PUP,Engineering,COE,2011,Implementation of Library System with Biometrics and Barcode Application in San Mateo National High School,"School library exists to provide a range of learning opportunities for students, faculty, and staff, even including outside researchers with a focus on intellectual content, information literacy, and the learner. In addition to classroom visits with collaborating teachers, the school library also serves as a place for students to do independent work, use computers, equipment and research materials; to host special events such as author visits and book clubs; and for tutoring and testing. The San Mateo National High School library is using traditional way of logging in / out in the form of log book and catalogue system which is in the manual method by using index card. The librarian encounter problems in doing transactions like borrowing books, checking the availability of the books, returning and updating of books because all the transaction are being done manually, as a result, the process is time consuming. A way of coping with this is installing a computerized library system which will help the library personnel or the librarian in monitoring the books accurately. Further, the use of cataloguing will be made easier through an advance system provided by this study. Collaboration of the old and new techniques leads to a much better result.
The research entitled “Implementation of Library System with Biometrics and Barcode Application is San Mateo National High School” covers installation of library system with biometrics and barcode application. The fingerprints will be scanned by a fingerprint type biometrics and the database will take charge of the info of the user, it will show the info of the respondents if he/she already borrowed or has a pending of borrowed books and also the database will record the time and date of the log in and log out of the students and faculties. For the cataloguing, borrowing and returning of books, we used a barcode scanner type that was interfaced in the pc unit and also we provide the barcodes for the borrowing process of books, instead of using the old ways of cataloguing all the borrowed books will be recorded in the database, and the administrator (librarian) is the one in charge for monitoring of the borrowed books. The design project aims to implement Library System with Biometrics and Barcode Application in San Mateo National High school and to investigate the effectiveness of the computerized library system in order to support the continuous learning in various pedagogical settings. To achieve this primary goal, the study should consider the three objectives. First is to apply the digital and information technology in public high school library. Second is to develop the library system of San Mateo National High School in terms if innovation, accuracy, speed, convenience and systematization. Third is to determine the impact of the library system to the students and faculty members of San Mateo National High School.

These tribikes are intended for PWDs who cannot use their feet to pedal; instead, to operate it, hand-cranks or arm pedals are installed. However, difficulties like controlling and driving the tribike on inclined roads and long trips are experienced by their users. To eliminate these, the existing tribike should be improved thru installing motor and features like throttle, LCD display and headlights. In addition, to recharge the batteries, aside from plugging it in an AC outlet, the mechanical motion from the pedal is converted to electrical energy that will charge the batteries of the motor thru a DC generator attached to drive axle. A voltmeter circuit measures the amount of battery charge and sends this signal to the microcontroller unit. A microcontroller unit controls the output in the LCD display indicating the battery meter. This will result in an improved arm-pedal tribike that is self-charging, faster and more efficient. The maximum climb slope is limited to 15 degrees and the prototype is intended to those experienced arm-pedal tribike users. The duration and distance to charge the battery is in trial as of now.

The sprays or pesticide are also helpful but the chemicals can be harmful to humans when made contact. Insect coils are the ones that are traditionally used, but in today’s time, we don’t want smoke inside our house anymore. There are many insect repellent devices that are already available in the market, but they need to be operated manually and are restricted for indoor use only. The proponents intend to create an electronic insect repellent that can drive insects away from people that are possible to use even when outside the home and is applicable to all. The proponents created a circuit (mainly composed of transmitter and receiver) that can produce frequency at a certain level that can drive away some insects. We’ve also used solar panel for the source so that the device can be used outside without plugging in.
The insect it can repel depends on its sensitivity to the frequency. There are some insects that get irritate at a certain level and there are some that are pleased with the same level. The solar panel provides the energy and converts it to electricity for the device to function so people can save energy. The device is safe and effective to humans.

Two years ago, the 60kph speed limit was implemented and a speed gun was procured by the MMDA to help them out in apprehending violators.  The use of speed guns have some disadvantages though: operation can only be conducted during the day because camera performance is affected during the night and monitoring is done randomly because of the limited number of speed guns.  The proponents developed a new system that would make sure that all vehicles’ speed are monitored 24/7. The system consists of transmitters and receivers equipped with XBEE and GSM Shields for interaction between modules. The receivers are the devices to be installed in vehicles that would constantly monitor the vehicle’s speed thru the use of a car transmission sensor.. Transmitters on the other hand, are the ones responsible for alerting the device (receiver) to maintain a speed lower than 60kph the moment the vehicle enters the Commonwealth Avenue premises or stop the monitoring once it leaves the avenue. Once the vehicle goes over the speed limit for 5 seconds, it would send the vehicle’s information along with the speed, time and date to a database thru SMS which will also be posted in a webpage real time. This system will make sure that all violators would be apprehended regardless of the time and place.

It is conducted so that students can apply their learnings in school to the field of their expertise. A student is required to attend meetings held in the University regarding their practicum whether it is deadline of a specific document, updates on the field or announcement. Professors use messengers and social networking sites to disseminate schedules and announcements for their students. Often times, these sites are blocked from the companies where students work for their practicum. 

	Also, supervisors and advisers seldom communicate with each other, due to time and schedule conflicts making them not being able to talk or converse about the student’s status regarding the student’s practicum in a certain company. Parents also worry about the attendance and performance of their child in the practicum field due to lack of communication with their child and lack of clear communication with the practicum adviser. Here comes the idea of creating a system that would aid in solving the problems that those involved in the practicum course face. Researchers have conducted a solution and create an output with it.

PUP,Engineering,COE,2013,Online Practicum Monitoring System for College of Engineering,"Practicum is a part of the curriculum of every college in a university. It is conducted so that students can apply their learnings in school to the field of their expertise. A student is required to attend meetings held in the University regarding their practicum whether it is deadline of a specific document, updates on the field or announcement. Professors use messengers and social networking sites to disseminate schedules and announcements for their students. Often times, these sites are blocked from the companies where students work for their practicum. 

	Also, supervisors and advisers seldom communicate with each other, due to time and schedule conflicts making them not being able to talk or converse about the student’s status regarding the student’s practicum in a certain company. Parents also worry about the attendance and performance of their child in the practicum field due to lack of communication with their child and lack of clear communication with the practicum adviser. Here comes the idea of creating a system that would aid in solving the problems that those involved in the practicum course face. Researchers have conducted a solution and create an output with it. Through the use of web-based application, students can submit their requirements on time and at the same time, professors can update their students with their schedules and announcements.

The role of the child module is to transmit signal over interview and survey from the members of the Down Syndrome Association of the Philippines, Inc., and organization established in 1992 that brings together children with down’s and their families which chose Mrs. Corazon Magallon and her son Angelo, as the beneficiary of the project. Findings show that the project’s safe zone is less than five meters. When the child steps out of the safe zone, the parent module’s two alert features, the beeping sound and the vibrating alert, activate. The parent module is also earphone-capable which means that the beeping sound activates on the earphone when the parent inserts it to the socket. In addition, the parent module has two low battery indicators. One indicator turns on when the parent module’s battery source reached its low battery reference voltage. The other indicator at the parent module turns on when it receives a signal from the child module’s low battery indicator. Although there is low battery indicator of the child module at the parent module, the child module still has its own low battery indicator.
This project can be one of the many applications of Radio Frequency technology. Based on the surveys and interview, Child Monitoring using Radio Frequency Technology is ideal to parents who find it hard to keep an eye on their child when outdoors.

PUP,Engineering,COE,2013,Microcontroller-Based Car Power Management System,"There are plenty of car devices that don’t automatically get into sleep when you turn off the car engine. Those are devices that keep on using the energy causing the battery to drain.  The causes for a battery of a car to discharge totally is when there is a load (e.g., car radio, headlights, keyless security system, etc.) while the engine is off, causing it to drain. The headlight consumes a huge amount of energy, at least 45 Watts from the car's battery causing it to drain faster. For the reason, that the car has an alternator which charges the battery only when the engine is turned on. This alternator works together with the battery to supply power when the vehicle is running.

The device will notify the user by SMS and by LCD display if the car's battery shows signs of depletion. The user will be notified prior to a level of battery where the voltage is not enough to start the vehicle. Because the user will be notified, he can take pre-emptive measures to prevent the car to stall in the middle of the road due to battery depletion. And also because the starter motor of a vehicle requires large amount of current to be able to start the vehicle. 

The device also has an automatic headlight shut-off system to prevent early battery depletion by automatically shutting-off the headlight after the car’s engine is turned off. The device will prevent heavy traffic due to a car stall in the middle of the road, it will also prevent hassle for the user due to the car that has a depleted battery needs to be jump-start (requires two vehicles) or push-start (requires at least two persons) to be able to function again.
